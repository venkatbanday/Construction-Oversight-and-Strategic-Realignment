# Construction Oversight and Strategic Realignment

Construction Oversight & Strategic Realignment – Fortray Global Services, UK

Overview:

Led the strategic review and recovery of a delayed and over-budget three-storey construction project by addressing design inefficiencies, vendor underperformance, and execution gaps.

Key Achievements:

• Conducted a full audit of project delivery, identifying scope creep, vendor inefficiencies, and budget leakage.

• Recommended critical changes, including design optimisation, vendor replacement, and the addition of an extra floor to enhance project value.

• Aligned project delivery with the triple constraint framework (scope, cost, time) to re-establish control and prioritise deliverables.

• Prevented further budget and schedule overruns, restoring strategic direction, stakeholder confidence, and timely recovery.
