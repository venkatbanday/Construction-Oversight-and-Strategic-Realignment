# Construction-Oversight-and-Strategic-Realignment
Objective:
To realign an over-budget and delayed three-storey construction project by addressing design inefficiencies and execution flaws.
•	Highlights:
• Audited the entire project for scope creep, vendor inefficiencies, and budget leaks.
• Recommended design changes, vendor replacement, and the addition of an extra floor.
• Introduced a strategy aligned with the triple constraint model (scope, cost, and time).
Impact:
Prevented further overruns, restored strategic direction, and enabled timely project recovery.
