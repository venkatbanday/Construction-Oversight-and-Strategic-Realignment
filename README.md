# Construction-Oversight-and-Strategic-Realignment

**Construction Project Overview**

The project involves constructing a three-story building. All designs, layouts, permissions, and approvals are in place. Although the project has started, it remains incomplete and has exceeded the original budget.

**Steps Taken**

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the entire process from start to finish. In our review, we identified several alternatives, including design modifications, the possibility of adding another floor, and changes to contractors. 

In construction projects, especially those involving fixed parameters such as time, scope, and cost, it is crucial to avoid modifications during execution to achieve the desired outcomes. The primary reason for the failure of such projects often stems from allowing changes, which in turn affects all key factors: time, cost, and scope.

Construction Oversight and Strategic Realignment

Audited an underperforming 3-storey build project for scope creep and budget leaks. 
Proposed design & vendor revisions aligned with the fixed triple constraint model. 
Enabled recovery path aligned with delivery timeline.
